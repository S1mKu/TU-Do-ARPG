-- WARNING: we create a lot of X-Rays of a potentially large space in this
-- pipeline. For example, running over the
-- cartographer_paper_deutsches_museum.bag requires ~25GiB of memory. You can
-- reduce this by writing fewer X-Rays or upping VOXEL_SIZE - which is the size
-- of a pixel in a X-Ray.
